NOTE: For SFS analyses you should
#        have a VCF filtered based on depth of coverage (DP>10), 
#        but also discarding regions with very high coverage and 
#        with excess heterozygosity across all individuals,
#        as those could be due to mapping errors in repetitive or structural variants, 
#        including duplicated regions, discarding sites with low mapping quality.
#        NOTE: you should not have a MAF filter, as SFS is very sensitive
#        to rare variants!

# REQUIRED FILES:
# - vcffile
#   	 VCF file. 
#        
# - indpopinfo 
#        Text file with two columns with individual ID and corresponding POP
#
# - Rscripts
#    - getMeanLimitsDP.r 
#        Script that reads the genotype (GT) and (DP) fields from a VCF
#        and outputs the median DP and the limits of DP per individual.
#        This will be done for just the individuals in the IndInfoFile.
#    - createBED_hwe.r 
# 	Script that reads files with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium results
# 	with the format from VCFTOOLS and outputs BED file with the sites that
# 	deviate from Hardy-Weinberg, showing an heterozygosity excess
#    - utilfunctions.r
#	script with definition of functions used by getMeanLimitsDP.r and createBED_hwe.r

You can modify the settings in the SETTINGS section of ProcessVCF.sh.
